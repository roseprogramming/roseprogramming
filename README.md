## About Me

Based in **Alicante**, I'm on a journey to build a solid foundation in data engineering through my studies in **Higher Education Vocational Training (DAM)** and a **Master's in Data & Analytics**. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-world scenarios.

### 👀 I’m interested in...

* **Data Engineering & ETL/ELT:** Designing and building robust data pipelines (workflows).
* **Backend Development:** Architecting application logic (Java, Python).
* **Database Management:** Advanced query optimization (SQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB).
* **Compliance & Data Governance:** Applying legal rigor to ensure data integrity and compliance standards.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...

* **Cloud Data Services (AWS):** Deepening knowledge in S3, EC2, and database services essential for data infrastructure.
* **Big Data Tools:** Exploring tools for data workflow orchestration (like Apache Airflow).
* **Data Modeling:** Advanced techniques for efficient data warehousing.

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on...

* Projects that involve **building Python/SQL data pipelines** from scratch.
* Initiatives that require both **technical analysis and regulatory compliance** (e.g., FinTech or legal-tech).
* Open-source contributions focused on **data architecture or backend logic**.
